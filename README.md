Experiment 2: Numerical Python NUMPY

1. Normalization Problem
> In Normalization Problem, the prompt is to create a 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to a variable X. Utilization of .mean() and .std() calls are required to normalize X. The result should be saved as X_normalized.npy

2. Divisible by 3 Problem
> In Divisible by 3 Problem, there is 10 x 10 ndarray of the squares of the first 100 positive integers. It is required to determine the elements that are divisible by 3. The result should be saved as div_by_3.npy
